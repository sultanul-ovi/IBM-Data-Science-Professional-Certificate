# Introduction to Data Visualization Tools
> Data visualization is a way of presenting complex data in a form that is graphical and easy to understand. When analyzing large volumes of data and making data-driven decisions, data visualization is crucial. In this module, you will learn about data visualization and some key best practices to follow when creating plots and visuals. You will discover the history and the architecture of Matplotlib. Furthermore, you will learn about basic plotting with Matplotlib and explore the dataset on Canadian immigration, which you will use during the course. Lastly, you will analyze data in a data frame and generate line plots using Matplotlib.
