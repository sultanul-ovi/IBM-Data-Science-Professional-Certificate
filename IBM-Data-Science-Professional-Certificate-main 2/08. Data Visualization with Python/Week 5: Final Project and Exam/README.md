# Final Project and Exam
> The primary focus of this module is to practice the skills gained earlier in the course and then demonstrate those skills in your final assignment. For the final assignment you will analyze historical automobile sales data covering periods of recession and non-recession. You will bring your analysis to life using visualization techniques and then display the plots and graphs on dashboards. Finally, you will submit your assignment for peer review and you will review an assignment from one of your peers. To wrap up the course you will take a final exam in the form of a timed quiz.
# Learning Objectives
- Practice creating a dashboard
- Practice visualization skills
- Review and grade an assignment submitted by peers
- Create a dashboard and add interactivity
- Create various visualizations using a number of plot libraries
