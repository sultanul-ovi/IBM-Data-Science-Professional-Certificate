# Regression
> In this module, you will get a brief intro to regression. You learn about Linear, Non-linear, Simple and Multiple regression, and their applications. You apply all these methods on two different datasets, in the lab part. Also, you learn how to evaluate your regression model, and calculate its accuracy.
# Learning Objectives
- Describe the basics of regression.
- Explain simple linear regression.
- Describe approaches for evaluating regression models.
- Describe evaluation metrics for determining accuracy of regression models.
- Demonstrate understanding of multiple linear regression.
- Apply Simple and Multiple, Linear Regression on a dataset for estimation.
