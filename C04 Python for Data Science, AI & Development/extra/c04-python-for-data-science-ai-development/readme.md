- HTTP methods are a way of transmitting data over the internet We tell the Rest APIâ€™s what to do by sending a request. The request is usually communicated via an HTTP message. 
- The HTTP message usually contains a JSON file. This contains instructions for what operation we would like the service to perform. 
- This operation is transmitted to the webservice via the internet. The service performs the operation. In the similar manner, the webservice returns a response via an HTTP message, where the information is usually returned via a JSON file. This information is transmitted back to the client.
