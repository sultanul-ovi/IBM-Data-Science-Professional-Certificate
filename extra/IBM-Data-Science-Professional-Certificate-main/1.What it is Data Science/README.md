### My Definition of Data Science

Data science is the field of gaining insights from data, often focusing on using large volumes of data in many different formats, to solve business problems and provide value. It can cover the full data lifecycle from gathering data, analysis, modelling, and solution deployment. Data scientists do data science by applying scientific methods, programming skills, and analytical thinking. Aside from the technical aspects of data science, another important skill used by data scientists is the communication of findings/solutions by story-telling, as data should be used to solve problems, drive narratives, and lead to good decision-making.
