# Use of Generative AI for Data Science
> In this module, you will explore the role of generative AI in data science. Lesson 1 will cover generative AI for understanding data and model building. You will learn how data scientists can use generative AI to visualize, develop, and build models. Lesson 2 will cover the use of generative AI for data science regarding tools and techniques to help in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and develop a predictive model. You will learn about the industry-specific considerations while using generative AI and the challenges data scientists face. You will also learn about the skills data scientists require to succeed in their field and how generative AI can help them hone those skills in today’s world.
