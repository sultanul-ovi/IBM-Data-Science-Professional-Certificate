# Packages, APIs, Data Sets, and Models
> In this module, you will learn about the various libraries in data science. In addition, you will understand an API in relation to REST request and response. Further, in the module, you will explore open data sets on the Data Asset eXchange. Finally, you will learn how to use a machine learning model to solve a problem and navigate the Model Asset eXchange.
